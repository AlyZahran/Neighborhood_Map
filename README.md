## Neighborhood Map developed by Ali Zahran

### Project Overview:

There are a number of frameworks, libraries and APIs available to make this process more manageable and many employers are looking for specific skills in using these packages.

### What will You Learn ?
* You will learn how design patterns assist in developing a manageable codebase.
*  You’ll then explore how frameworks can decrease the time required developing an application and provide a number of utilities for you to use.
* you’ll implement third-party APIs that provide valuable data sets that can improve the quality of your application.

### How does this help Our Career ?
* Interacting with API servers is the primary function of Front-End Web Developers.
* Use of third-party libraries and APIs is a standard and acceptable practice that is encouraged.
* Asynchronous programming is important to understand in today's market.
